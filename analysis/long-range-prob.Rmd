# Adapting the Erlich et al. Model to Incorporate Zero-Inflated Negative Binomial Fertility Distributions

## Introduction

In the Erlich et al. model (2018), the probability of identifying an individual through genetic genealogy databases is calculated based on population genetics parameters and assumptions about family sizes. The original model assumes a Poisson distribution of family sizes with a constant mean number of children per family and a constant effective population size. However, real-world fertility data often exhibit overdispersion and zero-inflation, particularly when considering different populations.

Our goal is to adapt the original Erlich et al. model to incorporate a zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution for fertility, using accurate information about the fertility distributions for two different populations: European Americans and African Americans. We aim to model the distribution of fertility more accurately while staying as close as possible to the original model and its assumptions. This adaptation will allow us to refine the modelâ€™s predictions with minimal changes to the original functions.

> **Note:** The ZINB parameters (`mu`, `theta`, `pi`) need to be estimated accurately from separate analyses of fertility data for each population. In the code provided below, these parameters are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual estimates obtained from your data.

## Original Functions

Here are the original functions from the Erlich et al. model. These functions calculate the probability of a match for direct and once-removed relatives and compute the coverage of the database.

```r
# Define genome size and number of chromosomes
genome_size = 35 
num_chrs = 22

# Function to calculate the probability of a match for direct relatives
p_match = function(g, m, min_num_seg) {
  m = m / 100 # Convert m from cM to Morgans
  f = exp(-2 * g * m) / 2^(2 * g - 2) # Calculate f value
  pr = 1 - pbinom(min_num_seg - 1, num_chrs + genome_size * 2 * g, f) # Calculate probability
  return(pr)
}

# Function to calculate the probability of a match for once-removed relatives
p_match_or = function(g, m, min_num_seg) {
  m = m / 100 # Convert m from cM to Morgans
  f = exp(-(2 * g + 1) * m) / 2^(2 * g - 1) # Calculate f value
  pr = 1 - pbinom(min_num_seg - 1, num_chrs + genome_size * (2 * g + 1), f) # Calculate probability
  return(pr)
}

# Function to calculate the coverage of the database
coverage = function(Ks, maxg, N_pop, r, m, min_num_seg, min_num_rel, rep_direct = rep(1, 10), rep_or = rep(1, 10)) {
  N = N_pop / 2 # Convert population size to number of couples
  pr_succ = numeric(length(Ks)) # Initialize the vector of probabilities of success

  # Loop through database sizes
  for (i in seq_along(Ks)) {
    K = Ks[i] # Current database size
    K_same = round(K * (r / 2) / (1 + r / 2)) # Number of direct relatives
    K_or = round(K * 1 / (1 + r / 2)) # Number of once-removed relatives

    # Initialize vectors for probability calculations
    p_no_coal = numeric(maxg) 
    p_coal = numeric(maxg)
    p_no_coal_or = numeric(maxg) 
    p_coal_or = numeric(maxg)
    Ns = N * (r / 2)^(-(1:(maxg + 1))) # Ns values
    tot_p = 0
    tot_p_or = 0

    # Loop through generations
    for (g in 1:maxg) {
      f = 2^(2 * g - 2) / Ns[g] # Coalescence probability for direct relatives
      f_or = 2^(2 * g - 1) / Ns[g + 1] # Coalescence probability for once-removed relatives

      # Update probabilities
      if (g > 1) {
        p_coal[g] = p_no_coal[g - 1] * f
        p_no_coal[g] = p_no_coal[g - 1] * (1 - f)
        p_coal_or[g] = p_no_coal_or[g - 1] * f_or
        p_no_coal_or[g] = p_no_coal_or[g - 1] * (1 - f_or)
      } else {
        p_coal[g] = f 
        p_no_coal[g] = 1 - f 
        p_coal_or[g] = f_or 
        p_no_coal_or[g] = 1 - f_or
      }

      # Update total probabilities
      tot_p = tot_p + p_coal[g] * p_match(g, m, min_num_seg) * rep_direct[g] 
      if (g < maxg) {
        tot_p_or = tot_p_or + p_coal_or[g] * p_match_or(g, m, min_num_seg) * rep_or[g]
      } 
    }

    # Calculate probability of no success
    pr_no_succ = 0
    for (n in 0:(min_num_rel - 1)) {
      for (n_or in 0:n) {
        pr_no_succ = pr_no_succ + dbinom(n_or, K_or, tot_p_or) * dbinom(n - n_or, K_same, tot_p)
      }
    }
    
    # Calculate the probability of success
    pr_succ[i] = 1 - pr_no_succ
  }
  
  return(pr_succ)
}

# Ks: A vector of database sizes
# maxg: Maximum degree of relatedness to consider (e.g., 2 for first cousins)
# N_pop: Total population size
# r: Mean number of children per mating pair
# m: Minimum length in cM of a detectable segment
# min_num_seg: Minimum number of segments required to declare a match
# min_num_rel: Minimum number of relatives required to declare success
```

## Adaptation of the Functions

We aim to adapt the original functions to incorporate the zero-inflated negative binomial (ZINB) distribution parameters (`mu`, `theta`, `pi`) that accurately represent the fertility distributions for European Americans and African Americans. This involves modifying the coverage function to adjust the coalescence probability based on the variance in family sizes due to the ZINB distribution.

> **Note:** The ZINB parameters (`mu`, `theta`, `pi`) need to be estimated accurately from separate analyses of fertility data for each population. In the code below, these parameters are placeholders and should be replaced with your actual estimates.

## Conclusion

By adapting the original functions to incorporate the ZINB parameters, we have refined the model to more accurately represent the fertility distributions of European Americans and African Americans. We have made minimal changes to the original model, staying as close as possible to its assumptions and structure. This approach allows us to enhance the modelâ€™s accuracy with minimal effort, making it accessible for further analysis and contributions.
